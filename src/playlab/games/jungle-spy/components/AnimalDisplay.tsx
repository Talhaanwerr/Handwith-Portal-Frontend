/**
 * Shows the REAL PHOTO of an animal when one exists in
 * public/games/jungle-spy/animals/, and silently falls back to the pastel
 * SVG illustration when it doesn't — so photos can be added one at a time.
 *
 * The <img> is KEYED BY ANIMAL: switching letters mounts a fresh element,
 * so the previous animal's decoded frame can never linger on screen while
 * the next photo loads (the old un-keyed img kept showing the previous
 * picture for 1-2s). Failure state also resets per animal, so one missing
 * photo doesn't force every later animal onto the SVG fallback.
