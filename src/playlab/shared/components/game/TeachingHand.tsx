 * The ghost teaching hand: presses on a piece, glides it to its target,
 * releases, fades, and loops — until the child touches anything.
 *
 * Instructions in this product are visual first, because a 3-year-old who
 * cannot read still has to be able to start playing unaided. This is that
 * instruction. It is purely decorative (pointer-events-none, aria-hidden):
 * screen-reader users get the spoken clip and the per-piece aria-labels
 * instead, so nothing here is load-bearing for accessibility.
 *
 * Coordinates are relative to the positioned ancestor the hand is mounted
 * in — measure them against the same root the game's drag engine uses, so
 * the hand and the real drag agree on where things are.
