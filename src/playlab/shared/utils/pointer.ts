/**
 * Drag-and-drop primitives shared by the games that let a child carry
 * something across the screen (Feed the Shark, Magnet Match).
 *
 * Two rules are baked in here because both games learned them the hard way:
 *
 *  - Coordinates are ROOT-RELATIVE, never viewport-fixed. Game screens render
 *    inside a transformed Framer Motion ancestor, and position:fixed is
 *    broken relative to a transformed parent — a fixed drag ghost drifts away
 *    from the finger. Measuring against the game root is immune.
 *
 *  - Drop zones are INFLATED by a slop margin and resolved nearest-centre.
 *    Small fingers miss; the generous box forgives that, and when two
 *    inflated boxes overlap (easily on a narrow phone) the target the child
 *    was clearly aiming at wins instead of whichever happened to be first.
