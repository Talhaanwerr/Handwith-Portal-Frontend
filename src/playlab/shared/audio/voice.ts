/**
 * voice.ts — the narration engine. Plays pre-generated local clips (built by
 * scripts/generate-audio.mjs from manifest.json) through Howler.
 *
 * Design rules (the audio spec, distilled):
 *  - ONE spoken voice event at a time: starting any clip cleanly stops the
 *    previous one. No overlap, ever.
 *  - Deterministic timing: play() resolves on Howler's real `onend` event —
 *    never on a guessed setTimeout — so game states can `await` speech.
 *  - Text↔audio pairing: components read displayed text from the manifest via
 *    clipText(), so what is shown and what is spoken cannot drift apart.
 *  - NO silent Web Speech fallback. A missing file logs an unmissable dev
 *    error and resolves quickly so the game flow continues and the gap is
 *    obvious and fixable.
